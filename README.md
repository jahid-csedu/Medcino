# Medcino
An android application which was developed  as a personal pet project to keep track of medicines that people buy used by the pharmacies. 
This is basic crud based application with a small backend using PHP and MySQL. There are also some features for the doctors to keep track of the patients they served
and prescriptions they provide to them. Pharmacies can read the prescriptions from the system suggested by doctors and manage mediciens. There is also a notification system for the patients
where patients will get automatic notifications when their medicine finishes before the course completes.
